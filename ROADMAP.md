# Roadmap

This document is meant to give the community some idea of where we're going with the iOS SDK in the short and longer term.

## Short-Term

These are things we plan to be working on **within the next 3 months**.

- **Updated Networking Architecture**: This is now in beta and will be out hopefully within the next couple weeks. Please see [the beta branch PR](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/pull/1386) for more details.

- **Swift Codegen Rewrite, Continued**: As outlined in much greater detail in the [RFC issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/939), we're rewriting our code generation. This has taken ~~somewhat~~ a lot longer than expected, but the following phases are still in progress:
    
    - **Start generating code with Swift instead of Typescript**. This will allow much easier community contribution to code generation, and allow us to take on a bunch of improvements like `Hashable`, `Equatable`, and potentially `Identifiable` without having to fight with Typescript to do it.
    - **Add immutable caching to new generated code**. Caching is currently heavily tied into our existing parsing mechanism. We're going to separate that out in two phases: The first will allow caching that *cannot* be changed by the consumer.
    - **Add mutable caching to new generated code**. This is the final stage of updating caching: Allowing caching that *can* be changed by the consumer.
    - **Remove Old Codegen**. Once all this is built, older codegen will be deprecated. 

    You can follow this effort through the [Swift Codegen GitHub project](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/projects/2).
    

- **New Apple Hardware Support**: We're working to make sure Apple Silicon is fully supported when it comes out.

- **General bug-bashing**: There's still a few outstanding general issues and small feature requests I'd like to address, and we'll be dealing with any new issues as they come up.


## Long-Term

These are things we plan to be working on **beyond the next 3 months**. 

We're very open to any help we can get on these if your goals would be advanced by making these things work better sooner.

- **Dependency Manager test suite**. We've seen a few issues around things that work well for at least one of the three major iOS dependency managers, but causes problems in others. We plan to make a repo that we can use to automatically test for common issues against new versions of the library on CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager *before* they're released.

- **Wrapper libraries**. A very highly voted suggestion in our fall 2019 developer survey was wrapper libraries for concurrency helpers like RxSwift, Combine, and PromiseKit. 

    Note that we are **not** locked into any particular set of other dependencies to support yet, but we anticipate these will be wrappers in a separate repository that have Apollo as a dependency. As individual wrappers move into nearer-term work, we'll outline which specific ones we'll be supporting.
